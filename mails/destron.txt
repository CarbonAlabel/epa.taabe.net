Hi guys, 

Quiet a few of you will already know the meaning of the title, but for everyone else it means the following;

Eternal Pretorian Alliance atleast for the mean time will ceace to exist, with a alt holding the name and logo in the case that I decide to reform the alliance.

The reasoning behind it is two fold, I do nolonger have the commitment levels to sustain the alliance, atm I'm merely keeping a dieing animal on life support without the means to cure or treat it. Secondly I don't feel that anyone is willing to cure or treat the problems that torment the alliance.

My holding corp for the alliance will be inside the alliance in a couple of hours, if every CEO can declare support for it as executor, it would be of great help, and hopefully some day I have the willpower to revive the alliance and make it better than it is now.

If anyone has any final requests or questions please mail me (not as a reply please)

Sincerly
Destron Aurilen
EPA Executor
