Hi All - 

Just wanted to mail about our future. As some of you know, EPA is going into a Coma. Destron will probably keep it on life support until he has the will to revive it. Until then, we're leaving. 

Albatross is going back to Provi. We will be applying to join Sev3rance this week after I'm home from thanksgiving weekend, I have discussed it with their executor. See below for Q & A.

Q) What about wormholes?
A) The C5 is no longer a goal. We will however be keeping Hal as a second home, so we can go back and forth.

Q) Will we be NRDS?
A) Yes, in all of k-space (that includes high, low, and null). That means no more killing neutrals in amarr lowsec or null (not that we ever did much of that anyways). We will be NBSI in w-space, meaning we can still kill neutrals in hal. 

Q) Where will we go?
A) Aside from Hal, our new home will be KBP7-G IF the joining of sev3rance is a success this week. We already have an office there and you can install jump clones etc. there.

Q) What about teamspeak?
A) That will be determined at a later date.

Q) Can I have a pudding?
A) Only if you eat your meat. How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?

Q) What about the hal POS?
A) Since we are leaving EPA, any alts you have left in MOJU or other EPA corps will lose access to the SMAs. We'll be turning alliance access off until we figure out how to deal with alliance members accessing hal.

If you have further questions, send a mail to me (Murk).

Cheers (and happy danksgiving).
