	<h2>Alliance updates</h2>
	<p>Another two weeks, another round of alliance updates from me. I'm afraid you're going to have to get used to it :)</p>
	<h3>Welcoming our new members</h3>
	<p>
	<p class="corp"><img src="res/pasuk.png" alt="PASUK">Pasukan Khas Udara<br>CEO: Ular Belalang</p>
	<p>You might have seen them around the local pocket: Pasukan Khas Udara is a group of Hungarian players who have lived in Providence for a while and want to get in on a little more of the action(coalition fleets) without too much hassles or obligations.</p>
	<p class="corp"><img src="res/madtc.png" alt="MADTC">Mad Technology<br>CEO: Loprofile</p>
	<p>Mad Technology is a group of industrialists who live in Providence, want to be a part of a larger organization and get a small slice of the action.</p>
	<p>I hope you all enjoy yourselves and get a better taste of Providence.</p>
	<h3>Saying goodbye</h3>
	<p>
	<p class="corp"><img src="res/azdec.png" alt="AZDEC">Alpha Squad Delta backup with Charlie Company<br>CEO: Steve Akoi Aoiki</p>
	AZDEC were booted from EPA due to problems that their CEO and a few other members were causing with other coalition members, mainly <a href="http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Sev3rance">-7-</a>. Their CEO continued causing problems even after being confronted and told not to. Steve Akoi Aoiki and his alts are not welcome in EPA.
	<p class="corp"><img src="res/ospra.png" alt="OSPRA">Ospray Corp<br>CEO: Sybegh</p>
	<p>Ospray are wormholers who left due to an unfortunate problem: a misunderstanding of what we are about. Everyone who is in the alliance knows that we are laid back and primarily industrialists and explorers. Ospray were expecting 24/7 content from the start upon joining us: we all know this is not happening yet.</p>
	<h3>Bad news</h3>
	<p>The war is now ending but that was awful guys: it was a week longer than it should have been and damaged our indy guys quite a bit. I will not be as calm the next time it happens. I'm warning you guys, don't feed the pathetic fuckers kills!</p>
	<h3>Positives</h3>
	<p>Ehi, you are a machine, achieving the highest kills in the alliance by over 100, and rightfully earning the first 500M ISK prize that I have given out for PvP. I will run this monthly, along with full SRP for doctrine ships so you can focus on what you do best, shooting stuff. I would also like to congratulate Etin(second place) and Murkar(third place). Moons come first, once we deal with those I will sort out smaller prizes for 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> places.
	</p>
	<p>Word of warning, moon campaign is going to start running with form ups on Saturday and Sunday(6-7<sup>th</sup>). Max numbers: we need more money to fund cool stuff.</p>

	<h2>Updates to CCP's multiboxing policy</h2>
	<a href="https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=387571">https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=387571</a>
	<p>Multiboxing is an important part of EVE's culture. Using multiple accounts is useful in many situations. You can scout the route you are taking or light a cyno without begging someone else to do it for you, do your own hauling, or have some help in combat, either in the form of extra DPS or as fleet boosts. Most of us have at least one alt that they keep logged in along with their main, along with several more alt which are kept offline until we need them, and some of us have dozens of them. This is an average case, but there are some players which take multiboxing to its limits.</p>
	<figure class="fl"><img src="res/ice.png" alt="Ice">
		<figcaption>Ice fields in Providence are usually descended upon by different kinds of fleets...</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>Most of us have heard of fleets consisting of 20 or more mining barges descending upon ice systems in high sec, stripping the systems' anomalies of all ice in minutes, leaving nothing for the casual miners, and then moving on to the asteroid belts while waiting for more ice to spawn, leaving the systems devoid of any kind of ore to mine. These fleets, usually considered bot fleets by most players, aren't run by bots. They are run by actual people, which use multiboxing software such as
		<a href="http://isboxer.com/">ISBoxer</a> to run much more instances of EVE than an average player would, and simultaneously control their characters on all of them. This works by broadcasting the commands made in one instance of EVE onto all of the others, making the player control dozens of different accounts with no extra effort(aside from the effort included in setting up the multiboxing software).
	</p>
	<p>Such extreme cases of multiboxing aren't limited to mining: they can also be very useful in combat. There are multiboxers who fly entire fleets of combat ships by themselves: destroyers for ganking freighters in high sec, stealth bombers for dropping on unsuspecting carriers, even supercapitals for taking down sovereignty structures. All of these accounts are almost exclusively subscribed using PLEX. As buying such huge amounts of PLEX is expensive, amounting to tens of billions of ISK monthly, such multiboxers are almost always funded by large null sec coalitions to which such amounts of ISK aren't hard to part with due to the large amount of income coming from their renters and moon mining. This creates a problem: having more players doesn't mean much to the smaller organizations trying to make their first steps in null sec as the already present coalitions have a quite literal and extremely effective force multiplier. This is why multiboxing with input broadcasting is generally frowned upon by the majority of the EVE community.</p>
	<p>Up until now, CCP didn't consider input broadcasting important enough to outright ban it: only botting(input automation) was a punishable offense. However, starting with January 1<sup>st</sup> 2015, CCP will be policing input broadcasting on a two-strike policy much like it does input automation: with a 30 day ban for the first strike and a permanent ban for the second strike. However, players will still be allowed to use such software for various purposes which don't affect the EVE universe, such as automating the login process, resizing and arranging the windows of multiple instances of EVE running on a single computer and syncing the settings between multiple accounts.
	</p>
	<h3>How does this affect me?</h3>
	<p>It most likely doesn't, as I'm not aware of any members of our alliance which take multiboxing to the extents covered by the new policy. You are free to continue using your alts to make your life in New Eden easier. However, these changes might affect your life in New Eden in a different way...</p>
	<figure class="fr"><img src="res/plex.png" alt="PLEX price history">
		<figcaption>Graph of PLEX prices in Amarr for the last 3 months.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>Remember those mining fleets I mentioned above? While they are a major annoyance to casual miners, they also put a lot of raw materials on the market, playing an important part in EVE's industry, so once they are gone, we might see a rise in the prices of basic materials, which could in turn make mining more profitable, but also increase the prices of most ships and modules. This is already visible, as the mineral prices in trade hubs have slightly but noticeably risen. I also mentioned that those accounts are mostly subscribed using PLEX, which is why this change will decrease the demand for PLEX, causing the prices to fall. This change is much more noticeable: on the day before the announcement, PLEX prices started approaching the 1B ISK price, but after the announcement, PLEX prices plummeted down to just above 800M ISK. While the prices have started rising again and are approaching 900M ISK at the moment, this reduction in PLEX prices, even though temporary, is a welcome one to everyone who uses PLEX to pay for his monthly subscription.</p>

<article id="rhea">
	<h2>Coming to EVE Online in the Rhea release on December 9<sup>th</sup></h2>
	<p>Since the last issue, new features and more details on already announced features have been revealed, along with the full <a href="https://community.eveonline.com/news/patch-notes/patch-notes-for-rhea">patch notes</a>. Find out all about them here.</p>
	<h3><a href="https://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/a-new-era-of-clones/">Removal of clone grades and skill point loss</a></h3>
	<figure class="fl"><img src="res/clone.png" alt="Clone bay">
		<figcaption>The new clone bay window.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>Clone grades and skill point loss(except when losing a T3 strategic cruiser) will be removed as was planned. Additionally, the cost of changing your home station will be increased to 100&nbsp;000 ISK from the current 5600 ISK in order to make it a significant amount that still isn't too taxing. Also, the clone bay window has been cleaned up to better reflect the new cloning system.</p>
	<h3>Corporation invite changes</h3>
	<p>A series of improvements to the corp invitation process will be introduced in Rhea. A member of a corporation with the suitable permissions will be able to directly invite a character into the corporation, instead of having to approve an application first. These invitations will show up in the notifications system, and the amount of invites that can be sent out will be throttled in order to prevent spam. Also, players will be able to send an application from anywhere in space, even if they aren't docked, but will only be able to accept an invitation or quit a corporation when they are docked or in a capsule, instead of at any time as it is currently possible.</p>
	<h3>More eye candy</h3>
	<figure class="fr"><img src="res/jacket.png" alt="New jacket">
		<figcaption>Male Outlaw jacket(burnt orange).</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>New ship models for the Incursus, Blackbird and the Moa and their T2 variants will be introduced in Rhea. Also, a number of new clothes will be introduced. First, we have the Outlaw sets consisting of a jacket/coat, pants and boots, all available in both male and female versions and in Blood Raider, Guristas and Sansha colors from the NES. A special
		<em>burnt orange</em> version of the Outlaw jacket/coat will also be introduced, and judging by its description, we'll be getting it as a Christmas/New Year gift, courtesy of Intaki Commerce. Second type of clothing will be the Eternity suits, available in five different designs from the NES. Another category of items coming to the NES will be four new dreadnought skins, one for each race.
	</p>
	<p>Physical Based Rendering(PBR) is coming to all ships(except T3 strategic cruisers) and turrets/missile launchers. This is the first pass, and the following ones will see PBR applied to stations, starbase structures and eventually all objects in EVE. The hyped
		<a href="http://cdn1.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66669/1/AsteroidBeltN.png">asteroid belt effects</a> won't be coming in Rhea, as they aren't listed in the patch notes. We can assume they have been delayed for another release or discarded entirely because of their performance impact. However, there is no official word on it yet. What we know is that we will get a beta version of the
		<a href="http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/a-map-to-treasure/">new star map</a>, which isn't completely functional at the moment, but already looks much better than the old one, and has the option to be displayed in a window instead of in fullscreen mode only.</p>
	<h3>UI improvements</h3>
	<p>The
		<a href="https://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/a-new-look-for-eves-ui-feedback-needed/">new UI</a> will have selectable color themes and the option to match the theme to the ship you are currently flying. The blur effect and background transparency will be configurable. The killmail UI will be slightly modified to improve the visibility of nested items and make copying the external kill link easier. Health bars will be visible for drones in your drone bay, and there will be a "find group" icon in the market window, allowing you to quickly browse similar items in the market tree. Also, the notification system will be expanded to include killmails and contracts, and opt-in
		<a href="https://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/quick-give-me-manual-control/">manual ship control</a> is being introduced.</p>
	<h3><a href="https://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/thera-and-the-shattered-wormholes/">New wormholes and Sleepers in k-space</a></h3>
	<figure class="fl"><img src="res/sleeper.png" alt="Sleeper drone">
		<figcaption>Circadian Seeker, the new Sleeper drone.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>101 new shattered wormholes will become available in Rhea, including the hub system of Thera, the first wormhole system with NPC stations. Aside from those wormholes, we will also see a new type of sleeper drones roaming outside of wormhole space: the Circadian Seeker. Not much is known about them, except that they are somehow connected to the unidentified sites which have started popping up around New Eden: they contain a gigantic cloaked structure whose cloaking device seems to be malfunctioning. The one thing we do know is that they are busy scanning various objects they encounter roaming around systems. They appear to be peaceful, but be careful if you decide to engage them. Related to wormholes, the hacking minigame will get a distance indicator which will show you how close you are to something beneficial. This might make cracking harder relic/data sites much easier.</p>
	<h3>Balancing of laser turrets</h3>
	<p>The main change is the change to Scorch, the T2 long-range crystal for pulse lasers. The optimal range bonus on all Scorch crystals has been reduced from 50% to 40%, with the base optimal range on all pulse lasers being increased by 5%. This results in 2% less optimal range when using Scorch, and more range when using any other crystal. Additionally, the fallof range has been increased from 25% to 100% on all pulse laser, depending on the type. The second change, presumably because of the release of the Confessor, is to small beam lasers. They will get a 20% increase in DPS(with increased alpha and identical cap usage), 10% bonus to optimal range, 10% decrease in tracking speed, less falloff range and lower CPU fitting requirements.</p>
	<h3>New ships</h3>
	<p>Rhea brings us two new ships: the Bowhead and the Confessor. The Bowhead is an ORE freighter, specialized in moving large amounts of assembled ships. If it is destroyed, the ships in its ship maintenance bay will drop in the wreck(depending on the usual 50-50 chance) and you will be able to eject them from the wreck and board them. The same rule will now also apply to all other ships with a ship maintenance bay(Orcas, Rorquals, carriers...). It is expected to cost 20-30% less than other freighters, so it might see a lot of use, especially in high sec.
		<code>ORE Freighter Skill Bonus per level:

	<h2>Atron roam: Making new friends and blowing them up</h2>
	<p>On Saturday, November 29<sup>th</sup>, around 23:00 EVE time, Murkar Omaristos started an Atron roam. Atrons, aka Derptrons, are great frigates. Their speed and low skill requirements make them ideal for suicide roams. They can also deal up to 200 DPS each, but have little or no tank. It doesn't matter, as these Derptrons cost almost nothing. A fit with T2 guns and some extra T2 modules will only cost around 5M ISK. If you decide to only use meta modules, the cost of a fitted Derptron can be less than 1M ISK. In large numbers, they can apply thousands of DPS, enough to shred even the toughest targets to pieces in seconds.
	</p>
	<p>Fitted Derptrons were handed out for free at <a href="http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/F-YH5B">F-YH5B</a>, so 5 members of our alliance joined the fleet, along with 5 more players from other alliances. Aside from the Derptrons, we also got a Talwar and a Flycatcher to join us. Once ready, we set
		<a href="http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/6X7-JO">6X7-JO</a> as our destination. On our way there, in <a href="http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/WD-VTV">WD-VTV</a>, we found our first kill. A <a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42732681/">Scythe</a> was quickly destroyed by our Derptrons, along with its
		<a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42732720/">pod</a>. After scooping up the corpse and looting the wreck, we spent the next several minutes in the system looking for more targets, when an Occator jumped into the system. Aware that it might be bait, we decided to engage it anyway. What's the worst thing that could possibly happen?</p>
	<p>The worst thing possible <em>did</em> happen. Just as we started picking at the Occator's armor, a HERO fleet consisting of assorted frigates, destroyers and cruisers jumped into the system, forcing us to retreat and quickly destroying the ships that weren't fast enough to warp out. We lost a
		<a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42732725/">Talwar</a>, a <a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42732746/">Flycatcher</a>, two Derptrons and a single empty pod. After the losses, we decided to reform back at F-YH5B.</p>
	<p>Back at F-YH5B, we had a couple more players join us. This time, we set our destination to <a href="http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/CB4-Q2">CB4-Q2</a>, and went out, Derptrons only this time. We had more luck: soon after leaving, in the system <a href="http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/TA3T-3">TA3T-3</a>, we got two more kills. The first one was a
		<a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42733672/">Condor</a> and its <a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42733731/">pod</a>, and the second one was a
		<a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42733754/">Merlin</a>. We didn't immediately get the pod, as it managed to warp out, but due to some smart piloting by some of our members, they managed to follow it to the celestial it warped to, and popped the
		<a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42733862/">pod</a> as well. After that, we had a small friendly fire incident. We crossed paths with another blue fleet, but one of its members,
		<a href="http://evewho.com/pilot/Lee+Mcgee">Lee Mcgee</a>, was neutral to all of us. This led to some of our more trigger-happy fleet members assuming he is KOS, without actually consulting the
		<a href="http://kos.cva-eve.org/?q=Lee+Mcgee">KOS checker</a>. As they activated their scrams and disruptors, the rest of the fleet, hungry for kills, followed in suit and started attacking his Omen as well. Soon after we started attacking it, we were alerted by the other fleet that he is blue, and stopped firing. What can you say, NRDS at its finest.
	</p>
	<p>Moving on, we found a Hound in <a href="http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/KA6D-K">KA6D-K</a>. Unfortunately, as it launched a bomb, we warped off instead of engaging it. Only one of our members failed to warp away on time,
		<a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42734117/">dying</a> to the bomb. Heading deeper into HERO territory, we found one more kill, this one in <a href="http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/MB-NKE">MB-NKE</a>: a cyno <a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42734817/">Ibis</a> and its
		<a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42734846/">pod</a>. We stored the cyno that dropped from it, just in case we can somehow use it. A minute later, a Venture jumped into the system, but we didn't manage to land enough disruptors on it before it managed to warp away.</p>
	<p>Next, we headed towards
		<a href="http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/RNF-YH">RNF-YH</a>. It is a dead-end system and a popular ratting hub, and we were hoping to kill a ratting battleship or T3. After playing around with a Sabre on the gate to the system, we headed inside. After entering, the first thing we noticed was that the gate is heavily bubbled. The next thing we noticed was a Deimos inside the bubbles, which we tried attacking, but couldn't break its tank quick enough. As more hostiles warped in, we tried to burn out of the bubbles and warp to a safe spot. Only
		<a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42735041/">one</a> of us wasn't able to get out in time. Once we regrouped at the safe spot, we started scouting the system for easy kills, as it was obvious that the locals were well aware of our presence, and we couldn't kill something as big as a battleship before reinforcements arrived. Moments later, we found ourselves a target: a
		<a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42735281/">Merlin</a>. Even though it was sitting on the station, we managed to kill it along with its <a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42735297/">pod</a>. We warped back to the safe spot with no losses.</p>
	<p>Back at the safe spot, we noticed combat probes on D-Scan. They were trying to probe us down. First, we warped between safe spots in order to stop them from probing us down, but we soon got tired of it, and decided to stay in one place and wait for them to probe us down. It paid off: a small fleet warped to us, and managed to kill five of our ships, but not before we took down their
		<a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42735571/">Sabre</a>. Some of us warping away in our ships, some in our pods, we warped to another safe spot, and waited once again for them to probe us down.</p>
	<p>Soon enough, they did. Once they landed on grid, most of us decided to engage a Dramiel, but I chose to go after a Maulus which warped right on top of me instead. I quickly killed the
		<a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/42735853/">untanked</a> frigate, but I missed the pod. While the rest of our fleet was destroyed by the hostiles, I gained some distance from them while chasing the Maulus and managed to warp away just as a Proteus started firing at me with its railguns. Being the only one that escaped with his ship intact, I decided to initiate the self destruct timer on my ship. After it exploded, I did the same for my pod, all of it while having an emotional conversation with the locals. The timer was ticking down: 29 seconds, 19 seconds, 9 seconds...
	</p>
	<p>Back at F-YH5B, I upgraded my clone and started thinking about what to do next, when I noticed something strange about my wallet balance. <em>I don't remember having 800M in my wallet...</em></p>
	<figure class="fw"><img src="res/500m.png" alt="Wallet journal"></figure>
	<p>You're not too bad yourself, <a href="http://evewho.com/pilot/Skayarck+Arran">Skayarck Arran</a>.</p>
	<p>So, to sum it up: equal amounts of ISK were destroyed/lost, lots of fun was had by everyone involved, and 500M ISK ended up in my wallet. Op success!<br>
